Constructive Type Theory

Per Erik Rutger Martin-Löf is a Swedish logician, philosopher, and
mathematical statistician. He is internationally renowned for his work on
the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and
computer science. He drafted the first article on type theory that dates
back to 1971.

Pure Type System (PTS)

PTS is a framework that can be seen as a generalisation of Barendregt's
lambda cube, in the sense that all corners of the cube can be represented
as instances of a PTS with just two sorts. In fact, Barendregt (1991)
framed his cube in this setting. Pure type systems may obscure the
distinction between types and terms and collapse the type hierarchy, as it
is the case of the calculus of constructions, but this is not generally the
case, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus allows only terms to depend on
types.

1991

Simon Thompson published the book "Type Theory and Functional Programming",
which inspired HX's work on Dependent ML, the predecessor of ATS.

The first phase of the Fox project started. HX was later partly supported
by the Fox project (e.g., funds covering conference expenses).

######

1992

HX came to US from China, enrolling in the Mathematics Department at CMU as
a PhD student in the Pure and Applied Logic program. He studied under the
supervision of Prof. Peter Andrews, focusing on Automated Theorem Proving.
In particular, he worked on TPS, an automated theorem-proving system developed
and implemented by the research group of Prof. Andrews.

As TPS was written in the programming language Common LISP, HX started
learning LISP and using it to implement certain elementary features for TPS
(for instance, some simple editing commands)

######

1993

HX continued working on TPS. In particular, he was getting more and more
familiar with Common LISP and, especially, the debugging support for Common
LISP.

######

1994

HX continued working on TPS. While programming in Common LISP, he also
started getting a bit frustrated with the language as he had to spend so
much time debugging his code or code written by previous implementors of
TPS. He particularly noted that TPS code that had not been repeatedly
tested seemed to always have bugs when executed.
