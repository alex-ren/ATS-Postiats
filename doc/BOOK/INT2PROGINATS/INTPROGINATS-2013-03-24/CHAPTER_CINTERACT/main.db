<title>Interaction with the C Programming Language</title>

<para>
ATS and C share precisely the same native/flat/unboxed data representation.
As a consequence, there is no need for wrapping/unwrapping or
boxing/unboxing when calling from C a function in ATS or vice versa, and
there is also no run-time overhead for doing so.
