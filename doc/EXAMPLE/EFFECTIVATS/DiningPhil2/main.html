<h1>
Effective ATS: Dining Philosophers
</h1>

In this article, I present an implementation of a slight variant of the
famous problem of 5-Dining-Philosophers by Dijkstra that makes simple but
convincing use of linear types.

<h2>
The Original Problem 
</h2>

There are five philosophers sitting around a table and there are also 5
forks placed on the table such that each fork is located between the left
hand of a philosopher and the right hand of another philosopher. Each
philosopher does the following routine repeatedly: thinking and dining.  In
order to dine, a philosopher needs to first acquire two forks: one located
on his left-hand side and the other on his right-hand side. After
finishing dining, a philosopher puts the two acquired forks onto the table:
one on his left-hand side and the other on his right-hand side.

<h2>
A Variant of the Original Problem 
</h2>

The following twist is added to the original version:

<p>

After a fork is used, it becomes a "dirty" fork and needs to be put in a
tray for dirty forks. There is a cleaner who cleans dirty forks and then
puts them back on the table.
