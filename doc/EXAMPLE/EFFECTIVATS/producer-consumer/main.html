<h1>
Effective ATS: Producer-Consumer
</h1>

The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic one in concurrent programming.
In this article, I present an implementation of this problem that makes
highly effective use of dependent types and linear types. While the style
of programming I employ here may not be so easy to master, the great advantages
it brings can be readily appreciated.

<h2>
Description of the Problem 
</h2>

Given a buffer of finite capacity, there are multiple producers who insert
items into the buffer and also multiple consumers who take out items from
the buffer. If a producer wants to insert an item but the buffer is full,
the producer is blocked until the buffer becomes not full. If a consumer
wants to take out an item of the buffer is empty, then the consumer is
blocked until the buffer is not empty.
